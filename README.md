# WebShortcutRevamp

Don't use this in production. It will need a code cleanup.
However it's working fine.

## Configuration
* Import the web/init.sql in a database or create the tables manually.
* Edit the web/redirect.php and add you database credentials. Then upload it to a webhost that supports php
* Upload the config and the compiled plugin to your gameserver.
* Adjust the config to your needs.
* Load the plugin to generate the config in /cfg/sourcemod
* Edit the config and reload the plugin again.
* DONE
